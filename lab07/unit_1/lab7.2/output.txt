Pleasures remain
And forgettable
Words like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Painful to me
Can't you understand?
Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Words are meaningless
Into my little world
Pierce right through me
Oh, my little girl
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Words are very unnecessary
So does the pain
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Words are very unnecessary
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Words are very unnecessary
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Words are very unnecessary
Is here in my arms
They can only do harm
Is here in my arms
They can only do harm
Is here in my arms
They can only do harm
Is here in my arms
They can only do harm
